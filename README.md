# serverless-jenkins
This project is supposed to spin up a serverless jenkins environment
1. It demonstrates AWS Credential retrieval using IAM OIDC.
2. Also, demonstrates how we can create terraform infra using GitHub Actions, although this is not repeatable because that would require complex conflict resolution on AWS resource level and creating a Jenkins infra is not something one would need to do repetitively.
